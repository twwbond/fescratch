This is an outline what we did for a 8 session afterschool Scratch programming class.  We had previously run a Logo programming class but had found the typing/syntax along with the lab environment made it difficult for many kids to succeed.  We decided in early Fall 2012 to switch to Scratch.

Three months before class:

- Coordinate availability of parent volunteers.  We had 2 or 3 parents in class of 20-22.
- Check school calendar for holidays
- Reserve computer lab
- Get signup form approved by PTA and school front office
- Send out and process registration forms (this is most painful part!)
- Meet with school IT group to install/ensure Scratch available
- Understand how students will save projects.  Do not use flash drives as primary method

Class format was 5-10 minutes teacher intro, remaining time project time.


Students came in with anywhere from no experience with programming to having done Scratch at summer camp or at home so having a fixed agenda for all did not work.
